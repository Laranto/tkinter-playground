# Spacegame Prototype
## Concept
Humananity sits on a rock hurtling through space. There are many things around.
This game should explore possibilities for changes. 
The game ought to use scientific knowledge to simulate humanity's path into the solar system and the stars. 
The player takes control of policies and politics of earth and entities directly controlled.
The challenge of the game is resource scarcity, the human unhappyness, scession and war.

## Systems
Akin to Democracy 3 it's easiest to abstract systems as values / pools which change over time and can influence other pools.
